This markdown is written when we are working for the pre-delicate-frontend. Unfortunately, due to limited time, we have not yet combined it with our backend. But we are all very satisfied with this frontend interface. So we keep this markdown for the course project and provide the corresponding user guide.

## Motivation

### Problem Background
Traditional banking systems often rely on monolithic architectures, which can lead to limited scalability, reduced fault tolerance, and difficulty in maintaining or upgrading individual components. 

Moreover, transactional consistency and real-time responsiveness are critical issues, especially in financial applications involving sensitive monetary operations. Customers today expect banking services to be seamless, fast, secure, and available around the clock, presenting significant technical challenges to traditional system designs. 

For instance, during peak usage periods such as payday or holidays, traditional monolithic systems often experience slowdowns or even downtime, leading to customer dissatisfaction and potential financial losses for institutions.

### Why This Project is Worth Pursuing
By adopting a distributed microservices architecture enhanced with modern middleware technologies like Kafka, Redis, and Kubernetes, this project aims to address these challenges. The use of microservices enables independent scalability, improved fault isolation, and easier system upgrades without impacting overall availability. Implementing advanced features like the Saga compensation pattern for handling distributed transactions further enhances reliability and robustness, crucial for financial applications.

This project not only demonstrates modern, industry-standard technologies but also prepares the foundation for highly available, scalable, and secure banking transaction systems that align closely with industry trends and practical business needs.

### Our Target Users

- **Bank customers:** Individuals requiring reliable, secure, and instantaneous banking transactions, notifications, and account management.

- **Banking institutions:** Organizations aiming to provide scalable, modern digital financial services, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce technical debt associated with legacy systems.

- **Developers and IT teams:** Professionals seeking a modular, maintainable, and scalable architecture to manage and extend banking systems effectively.

### Existing Solutions and Limitations
Existing banking systems typically rely on traditional monolithic designs, limiting scalability, increasing downtime risks during updates, and complicating transaction management across distributed environments. Some solutions employ distributed systems but often lack comprehensive mechanisms for managing transactional integrity in distributed environments or real-time communication capabilities. This project addresses these limitations by integrating real-time notifications, robust transactional management via the Saga pattern, and cloud-based storage solutions for enhanced reliability and accessibility.

## Objectives

The primary objective of our project is to develop a distributed banking transaction system that leverages a microservices architecture, incorporating modern backend and frontend technologies. The system aims to provide reliable, scalable, and responsive banking operations, including user authentication, account management, cross-account transactions, real-time notifications, and cloud-based file handling.

## Technical Stack (Only Frontend)

* **React For Frontend**: A JavaScript library for building user        interfaces. Multiple hooks are applied to use Reactâ€™s features in functional components.
  - `useState`: Re-render the UI when state changes. Can be combined with CSS to implement visual switching when the state changes.
  - `useEffect`: Handle side effects. For example retrieving account data from the backend during page initialization.
* **React Router For Routing**: Enables developers to update the URL without reloading the page. This leads to a faster reaction when we switch to another page in the app. `useNavigate` is used in the project to jump from one page to another.
* **JSX**: Combines the power of JavaScript with the readability of HTML.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework with predefined classes for rapid UI development, which enables developers to define styles directly in JSX components using className without the need for additional CSS files. `@keyframes` is applied to implement animation effect.


## Features
### Core Features

#### 1. User Authentication and Authorization
- Implementation via the Auth Service using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

- Secure user registration, login functionalities, and session management.

- Real-time balance inquiries, account freezing, and closure options.

- Caching frequently queried data (account balances) using Redis to improve performance.

- Database: PostgreSQL (`accounts` table).

#### 3. Transaction Processing with Saga/Compensation Pattern
- Facilitate reliable cross-account fund transfers using the Saga transaction management pattern to ensure data consistency.

- Use Apache Kafka for event-driven architecture, handling debit and credit operations asynchronously.

- Robust error handling and automatic compensating actions in case of transaction failures.

- Database: PostgreSQL (`transactions`, `transaction_sagas`, `compensation_logs` tables).

#### 4. Real-Time Notifications
- Real-time transaction status updates using WebSocket (Socket.IO).

- Users receive immediate notifications upon transaction completion or failure, and account updates.

- Database: PostgreSQL (`notifications` table).

#### 5. Cloud File Handling
- Database: PostgreSQL (`files` table, storing blob URLs and metadata).

### Database Schema and Relationships

We use **PostgreSQL ** as our primary relational database, storing users, accounts, transactions, notifications, transaction Sagas, compensation logs, and files. Relations are clearly defined through foreign keys, ensuring data integrity and enabling complex queries and reporting. The schema is structured as follows:

- **Users** (`users`): linked to accounts, notifications, and file uploads.

- **Accounts** (`accounts`): linked to transactions.

- **Transactions** (`transactions`): linked with Saga transaction management (`transaction_sagas` and `compensation_logs`).

- **Notifications** and **Files**: directly linked with users.

### User Interface and Experience Design
- Simplified yet comprehensive frontend views using React components.

- User-friendly interfaces for login, account management, transaction initiation, notification viewing, and file uploads.

- Responsive design ensures accessibility on various devices, achieved with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.
